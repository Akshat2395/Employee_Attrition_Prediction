# Employee_Attrition_Prediction

## Overview

Attrition is the normal life cycle of employment. Employees who move, retire, pass away or leave the company to raise a family or attend school represent the usual ebb and flow of staffers through a business. In other words, when it comes to attrition, employees are leaving not because they have a problem with your company or their jobs – it’s a matter of life unfolding.
